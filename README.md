# Portfolio Project

## Description
The portfolio project was created so that I can have a single source that I can continually update and share my work so that those who browse my GitHub repo can see the progress I make. Here I have added some advanced CSS concepts that I have learned and will continue to update the styling of this portfolio as I continue to refine my skills. 

## Usage
My portfolio project can be used to check out my recent works and see the different applications that I create during the UCLA bootcamp and my work after I graduate. Click on the links under the "My Work" section and if you are interested in anything I have done, use the "Contact Me" resources to reach out to me.
